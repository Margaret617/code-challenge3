# Movie Ticket Booking System

This project is a simple web application that fetches movie data from a db.json file and displays it in a table format. Users can view movie details, buy tickets, and see the remaining tickets dynamically updated.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS: Structuring and styling the web page.
- JavaScript (ES6+): Fetching data, manipulating the DOM, and handling user interactions.
- JSON: Storing movie data in a db.json file.
## Features

- Displaying Movie Data: Movies are fetched from db.json and displayed in a table format.
- Ticket Booking: Users can click on "Buy Ticket" buttons to purchase tickets for a movie.
- Dynamic Updates: Ticket counters update dynamically when tickets are bought.
- Error Handling: Basic error logging to console if data fetching fails.
## How to Use

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone `git@github.com:Margaret617/code-challenge3.git`
Open index.html in your web browser.

Browse through the list of movies and click "Buy Ticket" to simulate booking tickets.

### File Structure
